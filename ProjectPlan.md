# Test different graph representations
See Table 1
SR and 3-SAT (2)
Use three models GCN, GAT, and pick one other (3)
(easy and medium difficulty only) (2)
(2x3x2 = 12)

# Test generalization across different problem types and difficulty levels
## Test over different problem types
SR and 3-SAT. (2)
Train on one problem type and score on different problem times keeping difficulty level constant (only easy and medium). (2x2x2)
Do for all models (3)
See Fig 3
(2x2x2x2x3 = 48)

## Test over different difficulty levels
SR and 3-SAT. (2)
Train on one difficulty level and score on the other keeping problem type constant. train (easy, medium) test (easy, medium, hard) (2x3)
Do for all models (3)
(2x2x3x3 = 36)
See Fig 4
